      <h3>Bettman: NHL 'very comfortable' with decision to skip Olympics</h3>
      <h3>March 1, 2018 at 3:00 AM<img src="http://www.cbc.ca/sports-content/hockey/opinion/assets_c/2013/09/bettman-gary-130612-thumb-620xauto-326845.jpg" width="290px"></h3>
      <p>The NHL has no regrets about not sending its players to the 2018 Winter Olympic Games, says commissioner Gary Bettman. "We've very comfortable with the decision we made as a league," Bettman said Wednesday.<br><br>The NHL announced in April it would not participate in the Pyeongchang Games. It was the first time in five Winter Olympics where the world's best hockey players didn't play.<br><br>Not having players in South Korea meant there was no "disruption to our season," said Bettman. It also ensured players remained healthy for the run to the playoffs. "The fact our teams would have come back in varying conditions, some teams more banged up and tired than teams where there<br>weren't that many players at the Olympics, we're very comfortable with it," he said.</p>
