  <h1>Hardware Report: VIVE Pro HMD VR Headset</h1><br>
  <img src="https://www.vive.com/media/filer_public/b6/8b/b68bf2eb-a0e1-4e8b-8f04-56126e49fc78/vive-pro_hp-banner-main-facebook.jpg">
  <h2>Price</h2>
  <p>$999 CAD, not including controllers, base stations, or adapters. Includes 6-month subscription to VIVEPORT.</p>

    <li>Ergonomics:	Eye relief with lens distance adjustment, adjustable IPD, adjustable headphone, adjustable headstrap</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Target Market</h2>
  <p>The target market for the Vive Pro is for experienced users seeking to upgrade to a high-end VR experience, as reflected by the high price, and the lack of basic accessories, which shows that they assume you have the original VIVE, which included these accessories.</p>
  <h2>Personal Opinion</h2>
  <p>Personally, I do not think this product will be very successful, as it will be hard for most people to justify spending a large amount of money on a system that will probably only be used for VR gaming. Gaming YouTubers and live streamers will see more use out of this product than the average user, due to the improved experience for their viewers, but the standard $699 VIVE still provides a great experience for more casual use.</p>
